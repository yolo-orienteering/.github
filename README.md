## 🚀 Features

### 🧩 Modular Architecture

- **Event Crawler**: A built-in crawler fetches orienteering events from public calendars and resources to keep the data fresh and relevant.
- **Mobile-optimized UI**: The frontend is built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) with the [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev/), ensuring a smooth experience on mobile devices.

### 🎯 Core Purpose

- Allow orienteers to **explore upcoming events**.
- Let users **select and manage** which orienteering competitions they want to attend.
